<p>The following are some type of Triangles.</p>


    <h2>The equilateral. </h2>
  <p><em>	In the equilateral triangle, all the sides are the same length (congruent)</br>
       and all the angles are the same size (congruent).  </br>
       Since the sum of the angles of a    triangle is always 180 degrees,</br>
        we can figure out the measure of the angles of an equilateral triangle:
</br></p>
<h3>The isosceles</h3>
<p>The isosceles triangle (I can NEVER remember how to spell isosceles) </br>
 has two sides that are the same length (congruent) </br>
and two angles that are the same size (congruent).</br></p>

 <h4>The Obtuse  </h4>
 <p>Obtuse triangles aren't very smart.  (Look up "obtuse" in the dictionary!)</br>
Obtuse triangles have one angle that is greater than 90 degrees.</br>
  (Obtuse triangles have one obtuse angle.)</p>

  <h5>The acute</h5>
<p>  Acute triangles are better looking than all the other triangles.
   (Pathetic attempt at a math joke.)</br>
Acute triangles have NO angles greater than or equal to 90 degrees-- all their angles </br>
are less than 90 degrees.(Acute triangles have all acute angles.)</p>
